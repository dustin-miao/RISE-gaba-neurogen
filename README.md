### Abstract

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) serves as the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter within the central nervous system (CNS). However, it has been documented to exhibit an excitatory effect specifically on immature neurons. While the cause of this shift has been reported as responses to GABA being dependent on intracellular chloride [Cl-] concentration, which is controlled by Na+-K+-2Cl− [NKCC1] and K+-Cl− [KCC2] co-transporters, there exists a lack of data on how exactly the cell’s response to GABA changes in relation to development. To address this question, we built a computational system to model the progression of GABA’s role from excitatory (depolarization) to inhibitory (hyperpolarization) throughout a neuron’s lifetime. Specifically, we recorded and analyzed the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of Cl- at different stages of development as well as the membrane potentials to visualize the relationship between GABA’s role and action potentials. To do this, we changed the expression levels of NKCC1 and KCC2 to represent the hypothesized dynamics of these proteins. We predict that our results will reveal the channel mechanisms necessary for GABA to switch from an excitatory to an inhibitory role. This information should suggest the point in time of a neuron’s development where responses to GABA change.
